# Wordpress Theme - Source

#### What this theme is:

Source is a starter Wordpress theme developed to quickly reiterate sites based on personal coding styles and naming conventions.

HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Compass, and PHP are the primary technologies used.

We use Sass as our styling preprocessor, and watch the changes in the terminal with Compass. Check out the "How to use this theme" section for more details.

Designed and developed by myself, Sean Hill.

#### What this theme isn't:

A full-fledged - to spec - Premium Wordpress theme.

I have not, and may not, add all of the Wordpress standards to this theme. I have cherry-picked the codes and layouts that I have found useful in my time developing sites.
