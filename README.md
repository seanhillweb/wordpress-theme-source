# Wordpress Theme - Source

#### What this theme is:

Source is a starter Wordpress theme developed to quickly reiterate sites based on personal coding styles and naming conventions.

HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Compass, and PHP are the primary technologies used.

Sass is used as our styling preprocessor, and Compass is used to watch the changes in terminal. Check out the "How to use this theme" section for more details.

Designed and developed by myself, Sean Hill.

#### What this theme isn't:

Perfect.

I have not, and may not, add all of the Wordpress standards to this theme. I have hand-picked the code and layouts that I have found useful in my time developing sites.

#### Who this theme is for:

I'm not exactly sure. Myself?

However, I've decided to put this out there for anyone who may think this can work for their needs. Even if it's just a snippet of code, a page template, or a functions reference - I would like to be able to help.

#### How to use this theme:

Styling this theme is easy, once you have the necessary dependicies.

1. [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install), which is an abbreviation for "Ruby Version Manager," to your machine.
